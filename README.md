# Single-Stage-Differential-Amplifier-based-OPAMP-Design-in-LTspice
– Designed a differential amplifier-based OPAMP in LTspice and verified its functionality through simulations,
including both inverting and non-inverting modes of operation.
– The proposed design provides a frequency bandwidth of 1MHz, with the frequency response resembling a low pass
filter.
